1. We used the DB methods to populate and search in the databases. But we didn't use cursor.
2. The index file is implemented by two btree database files. And we used binary search to locate the start position and end position of the range of the keys in order to faster the search. The second index database is used to generate secondary index on the key values, though it isn't necessary.
3. To be added.
